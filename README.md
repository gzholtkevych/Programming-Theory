  <tr><td><b>Brief Cource Description:</b></td><td>
  The course is structured in two parts corresponding to imperative and functional programming paradigms.
  Therefore, the introductory lecture is devoted to the programming paradigm concept.<br/>
  In the first part of the course, computability and related concepts are studied.
  The presentation of this part is based on the concept of a recursive function and the Unrestricted Register Machine (URM) model.
  The former is used to explain the concept of denotational semantics, while the latter is used to demonstrate the notion of operational semantics.
  On this basis, the following is demonstrated:
  <ul>
  <li>the relationship between the operational and denotational approaches to modeling semantics;</li>
  <li>the existence of universal programs and their practical significance;</li>
  <li>Rice and Rice-Shapiro Theorems; Kleene fixed-point and normal form Theorems.</li>
  </ul>
