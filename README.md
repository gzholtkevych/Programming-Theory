  The course is structured in two parts corresponding to imperative and functional programming paradigms.
  Therefore, the introductory lecture is devoted to the programming paradigm concept.<br/>
  In the first part of the course, computability and related concepts are studied.
  The presentation of this part is based on the concept of a recursive function and the Unrestricted Register Machine (URM) model.
  The former is used to explain the concept of denotational semantics, while the latter is used to demonstrate the notion of operational semantics.
  On this basis, the following is demonstrated:
  <ul>
  <li>the relationship between the operational and denotational approaches to modeling semantics;</li>
  <li>the existence of universal programs and their practical significance;</li>
  <li>Rice and Rice-Shapiro Theorems; Kleene fixed-point and normal form Theorems.</li>
  </ul>
  In contrast, the second part is devoted to functional programming.
  Students get acquainted with the typeless lambda calculus and the corresponding computational model.
  In addition, the method of modeling imperative programming using typeless lambda calculus is explained. This demonstrates the computational equivalence of imperative and functional paradigms in programming.<br/>
  Functional anomalies of the computational process are demonstrated. Thus, the problem of overcoming these anomalies arises.
  To solve this problem, the typing of lambda terms is proposed. The appropriate technique is demonstrated in the example of the simple typed lambda calculus.
  Also, the correspondence between enriched simple lambda calculus and constructive propositional logic (the Curry-Howard Correspondence) is discussed.
  The roadmap for enriching the typing of lambda terms is presented using Berendreght's Lambda Cube.<br/>
  At the end of the course, students meet The Coq Proof Assistant - the powerful software toolkit for verification software solutions.
